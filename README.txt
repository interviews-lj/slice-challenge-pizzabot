In order to startup the project you need to have NODE JS installed.
Setup step-by-step:

1. Open the Pizzabot Folder
2. Open Terminal/CMD in the current folder and run the command (this command is required to run the test later on): npm i
3. After everything is installed succesful run the command: npm start
4. In order to test the code run the command: npm test
5. If you want to run the program with different input than the specified script in the package.json file you can run the command (with arguments as you wish, this one is example only): node pizzabot "5x5 (1, 3) (4,4)"
